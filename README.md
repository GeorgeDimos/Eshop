# A simple e-shop made with Spring Boot.

In order to run you only need to create an "eshop" database and provide valid 
spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password in the application.properties file. 
 
```
$ mysql -u root -p

> create database eshop;
```

Login with "admin" as username and password or create a new user with your email.
